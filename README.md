# DBFoundations-Module07, Functions

## Introduction
This assignment addresses the purpose of a User Defined Function (UDF) and the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

## User Defined Function (UDF)
A User Defined Function (UDF) allows for SQL users to create a custom function for their specific needs. These can return a table of values, or just a single value. A UDF allows for increased complexity of SQL code, giving users the option to address infinite needs they may face when engaging in database management. 

## Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions
There are three main types of UDFs, categorized by the output they produce. A scalar function returns a single value once the function has been processed. An inline function and a multi-statement function produce tables once the function has been processed. The difference is that an inline function derives output from single select statement, where multi-statement is more complex in that it takes multi-statements.

## Summary
This assignment has explored the realm of UFDs in SQL, and the ways in which they operate.
